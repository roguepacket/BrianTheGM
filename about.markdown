I first started playing D&D around the age of twelve with 3.5e. Sessions where never regular and we were making things up while we went. After a year or two ttrpgs fell off my radar. In 2016 a friend wanted to get back into D&D after taking a long, 10+ year hiatus himself. He would DM a 5e game. I joined in, and after not too long I ended up taking over DMing for that group. After about three years of somewhat consistent sessions, the group's activity died down as life got busy. I found the OSR and decided to give Moldvay/Cook's B/X a shot as it seemed to take less prep and the playstyle seemed to suite me better. Early 2019 I started a new campaign with a new group using B/X and have been going strong since.
