title:  "Player-Facing Combat/Defensive Rolls"

About two months back I came across a Dungeon Craft video on [player-facing combat](https://youtu.be/L8If0mcYvnk). In the video Dan mentions systems like [MÖRK BORG](https://morkborg.com/) that have the players make all the combat rolls. So, rather than the GM rolling for the monster’s attacks, the players make a “defensive” roll. This essentially means the players make an inverted attack roll. This also means they’re using THAC0 which I think is kind of funny. I decided to give it a go and since I’m already running THAC0, a few numbers get swapped around. I’m used to running THAC0 as: `if (roll + modifiers) >= (THAC0 – target AC), you hit`. However, with players now rolling attacks for the monsters, the `target player rolls 1d20 + their AC. If the roll is greater than or equal to the monster’s THAC0, the monster hits` and I roll the damage.

Of my six players, only one has said they prefer me making the attack rolls for the monsters. The others seem to like it as they get to roll more often. I’m fairly indifferent about it, I guess. With most of the players enjoying it I may just keep going with it. As the GM, I end up rolling enough and usually jump at the chance to allow my players to take over tasks when possible.

As a side-note, while deciding if I wanted to implement "defensive rolls" I also found out Moldvay/Cook's B/X makes it appear that the DM makes all damage rolls, even for player's attacks (page B25).

After seeing this, I went through every edition from OD&D to 5e and B/X is the only edition that states it in this manner. Although, I do somewhat like the idea of the DM rolling all damage, I think my group is well beyond the point of changing that now.
